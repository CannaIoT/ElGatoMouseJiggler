This is "El Gato - The Mouse Jiggler" by Charlie's Electronic Devices For People (aka. Charlie-is-coding) ;)

This simple program is written for Arduino devices with ATMega32u processing unit, as it has native support for USB and thus can act as a mouse / keyboard emulator.

The device is set to emulate mouse move after desired time.

This is to prevent turning off your computer screen or logging out becouse of no activity on the computer (no mouse move or keyboard pressed).
